# Typography and color scheme

# Wireframes

Wireframes for the project were created with Balsamic and have been saved to wireframes folder within the assets folder.

The aim was to style each page consistently and keep the layout simple and clean. The designs created were very similar to the end product and being able to create these wireframes with balsamic allowed me to quickly move text and images around in order to find a balanced layout for each page.

Bootstrap 5 code used for Navbar.

2. Font Awesome - The use of Font Awesome Logos for social links and visual badges for some of the website information were used therefore credit to ‘Font Awesome’ for allowing links to their free library of icons.

3. W3Schools

W3Schools – I searched online for a basic picture gallery source of code and therefore adopted and then adjusted some coding which was available via their website. This is a basic picture gallery which allowes the user to click on the smaller pictures that then show below and are viewed bigger in size. I limited the amount of photos available to under 10 so that there was enough room on the web page, in addittion to this, the decision to only include a small amount of pictures was made so that the focus was on the better photos which represented the band in it’s most profesional light.

4. Google Fonts
