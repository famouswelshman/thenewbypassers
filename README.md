# Features

#### - __Navigation Bar__
The website features an interactive navbar to navigate the site with ease. This navbar which is a product of the Bootstrap code will be present on all pages and will adapt to each resolution by compressing the vav content to a dropdown icon when shown on smaller devices.

### - __Book the band Button__
The landing page features a prominent 'Book the band' button which gives the user the immediate facility to click on button to book if that is why the user has come directly to the website.

# Future features
The future aim of the site is to encourage returning visitors of the page to purchase the band related merchandise such as T-shirts and Logo Stickers. Additional media material will be available for user to view such as videos and downloadable music tracks exclusive to the website.

# Typography and color scheme
I chose a very basic color scheme which is losely based on the kind of colours within the bands logo which is the color - #cc0033. I was able to specify this color by using photoshop to identify the pink color within the logo. The main theme throughout is very black and white with some greys. This conveys a sort of photographic feel to the site which is synonymous with the content being in relation to a rock band and performing and capturing that live feeling!

I used several fonts from google fonts, the most stand out of these being the 'Monoton' font type. It's bold and colourful, again using the same shade of pink as per the band logo. I beleive this font type compliments the headings of sections where there is content, its a nice swirly font type which in turn compliments the other fonts included which are Montserrat and Satisfy which are used for more of the paragraph based text. I set the default font-family to sans serif in the event that the font types do not load.

# Wireframes
The aim was to style each page consistently and keep the layout simple and clean. The designs created were very similar to the end product and being able to create these wireframes with balsamic allowed me to quickly move text and images around in order to find a balanced layout for each page. In order to create some continuity with design, I needed to create a template which incorporated desktop, tablet and mobile phone as per the images below.

# Testing
1. Code Validation (W3 Validator)

2. Bugs when running the website on Github link - https://famouswelshman.github.io/thenewbypassers/

3. Supported screens and browsers




# Deployment
1. Via Github / Vs Code
Firstly I setup an account with GitHub and created a new Repository for this project. Using the installed desktop version of VS Code, I created several skeleton html pages and a master css file along with the neccessary folders to host the content. Whilst writing my code, I would use the live browser function within VS Code which shows my content and displays any changes upon refresh.
On completion of the basic files, I proceeded to upload this content via the Upload function on Github. 

Following the installation of the github repo extension for my desktop VS Code, I cloned the main branch of the repository to my local computer file and proceeded to work on my code.

Any changes made over the course of building this project would be reflected in my commits which show up on the github history. These commits were done via my desktop which were done by saving any changes, pushing and creating the commits.

2. Via Github pages
With these commit changes taking place, any content on the Github repository would be updated and therefore ammendments would be evident when going to the repository link to where the website is being hosted - https://famouswelshman.github.io/thenewbypassers/


# Credits
1. Bootstrap 5 (https://getbootstrap.com/)

Bootstrap 5 code used for Navbar which is a set piece of responsive code that is one of many supplied by Bootstrap for the purpose of making your website more intuitive and responsive and consistent across all pages. This navbar code which is linked by adding the Bootstrap link into the Head tag displays a basic, clickable navbar which reverts to an icon dropdown button upon the web page being made smaller or the content appearing on a smaller device such as a mobile handset. Bootstrap is also connected to Javascript which I have also linked into the content of each page.


2. Font Awesome - (www.fontawesome.com)

Font Awesome - The use of Font Awesome Logos for social links and visual badges for some of the website information were used therefore credit to ‘Font Awesome’ for allowing links to their free library of icons.

3. W3Schools (www.w3schools.com)

W3Schools – I searched online for a basic picture gallery source of code and therefore adopted and then adjusted some coding which was available via their website. This is a basic picture gallery which allowes the user to click on the smaller pictures that then show below and are viewed bigger in size. I limited the amount of photos available to under 10 so that there was enough room on the web page, in addittion to this, the decision to only include a small amount of pictures was made so that the focus was on the better photos which represented the band in it’s most profesional light.

4. Google Fonts - (https://fonts.google.com/)

I included links to four specific font types via Google Fonts. The process of including these font types are quick and easy and there is a superb library of fonts to choose from.

5. Formspree - (www.formspree.io/)

In order for me to include a contact form witht the website I used a server link via Formspree. The process of setting up a PHP form and hosting this would have been a bit complex at this point therefore I have opted for a pre-made system that serves the purpose of directing enquiries to a designated email address via the website. I did however create my own form using a mix of CSS styling and specific fields so that I could capture the basic data to fulfill the contact form request.

6. Youtube - (www.youtube.com)

I simply copied the embedded video code for each of the videos hosted on the site which are by default uploaded to youtube therefore the display of the video and the user controls are provided by Youtube.
